                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I've been studying Interactive Web Design and Development for a few months now and I've learnt some pretty interesting things about creating websites. I'd like to share my knowledge with anyone who is a beginner web designer/developer looking to add some cool features, so that they can take their website to the next level. I'll be exchanging some HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Mobile device code and techniques, but first, I should explain a little bit about what HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript are. <em>Note: All techniques that I've provided have also been implemented throughout this site</em></p>

                    <h2>HTML5</h2>        
                    <p><img src="images/html5_logo.png" width="220" height="220" alt="HTML5 logo"><dfn><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML5</abbr></dfn>  is the latest version of HTML. It is a markup language made up of different elements and attributes. Elements are pieces of code used to mark up different areas of content. Attributes are used to add additional information to elements. HTML5 has the capability of using both HTML and XHTML syntax. XHTML is stricter as opposed to HTML. For example: XHTML requires that all elements and attributes be written in lowercase, attribute values need quotes, and all element tags must be closed while HTML allows you to do the opposite. I've been taught with XHTML syntax and I believe itâ€™s better practice. HTML5 also introduces new elements and attributes that weren't available with HTML4 such as:</p>

                        <li> article</li>
                        <li> aside </li>
                        <li> footer </li>
                        <li> header </li>
                        <li> nav </li>
                        <li> section </li>
                        <li> charset </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>CSS3</h2>
                    <p><img src="images/css_logo.png" width="220" height="220" alt="CSS3 logo"><dfn><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS3</abbr></dfn> is a style language that lets you control how you want your web page/site to look. CSS works with XHTML / HTML5 that it selects the elements and lets you control the font, colour, size, width, height, and position and so on of that element. There are 3 different types of CSS: inline (embedded), internal, and external. Inline is where you do all your styling in the head section of the HTML code, internal is where you do all your styling throughout the HTML code as part of the elements, and external is where you do all your styling in a different page of its own dedicated for the site's styling. External is the best way of doing CSS styling.</p>

                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>                 
                    <p><img src="images/javascript_logo.png" width="200" height="220" alt="JavaScript logo">JavaScript is a scripting language that lets you control the behaviour of your web page/site. Whenever a user clicks, hovers, scrolls, or does anything on your site, you can control what happens using JavaScript. Just like CSS, JavaScript selects HTML elements and lets you control what will happen to them. JavaScript is more complicated than HTML and CSS, which is why JQuery was created to simplify JavaScript. JQuery is a library of code that goes with JavaScript to make using it a lot easier.</p>
