        		<h2>CIBC vs TD vs RBC</h2>
                <p>Welcome to The <em>Competitive Analysis Corner</em>! This week I will be doing a competitive analysis for some businesses that definitely know the value of a dollar; CIBC, TD, and RBC. More specifically I'll be analyzing their websites and grading them on 5 categories: Usability, Accessibility, Design, Content, and Branding. </p>

            	<h2>The Analysis</h2>
                <p>CIBC received a score of 180/200(90%), TD with a 161/200(81%), and RBC with 152/200(76%).</p>

            	<h2>What did they do right?</h2>
                <p>CIBC's website was the overall winner of the competitive analysis against its competitors TD and RBC. CIBC received a perfect score of 40 for the branding section. They have a great logo design, in a good position, they use company colours effectively throughout the site, and their brand is consistent throughout the site. Design was their second best section; I was impressed when I first saw the site. It uses colours and images well, it's simple and balanced, and overall it's a good design layout. Some other areas where I thought the site did a great doing was keeping the main content above the fold, links and button are clear they are links and buttons, their headers are clear, visible, and have a visual hierarchy, they have effective calls to actions, and navigating the site as well as completing tasks are easy to do and easy to find what I'm looking for.</p>

            	<h2>What would I use?</h2>
                <p>The local secondary navigation is definitely a feature I want to try on some of my future work. I haven't used local secondary navigation much in any of my work and it would be interesting to incorporate and design. I also liked the organization/layout of the site and it gave me of what I could do to organize/layout websites in my future work. </p>
